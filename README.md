# polynomials
Simple class project in C++ about polynomials

# Assumptions of the project
-parsing input string to object class "Wielomian" which means in english "Polynomial"
-simple operators including operations of adding, subtracting, multiplication, division, modulo, in and out streams, equality and assignment,

there is no functional menu added right now, but I would consider making one using linked list or dynamic array of Polynomials to make that project more functionality
